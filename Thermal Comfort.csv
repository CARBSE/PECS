Whole-body Discomfort,"The overall experience of thermal strain or dissatisfaction, resulting from an imbalance between local discomforts across different body regions. whole-body discomfort can arise when certain critical body segments (e.g., extremities or the torso) experience excessive warmth or cold, even if other areas remain neutral. persistent whole-body discomfort may drive behavioural or physiological responses, such as clothing adjustments or seeking external heating/cooling sources.",Thermophysiology
Whole-body Thermal Comfort,"The overall perception of thermal acceptability across the entire body, influenced by the combined effects of local thermal comfort across different body segments. whole-body thermal comfort is achieved when the body experiences a thermal state where no strong discomfort signals arise from any specific region. however, it is not necessarily the sum of individual local thermal comforts, as some body regions have a greater influence than others. a mismatch between local and whole-body comfort can occur when certain areas (e.g., hands or feet) feel too warm or too cold, even if other regions remain neutral.",Thermophysiology
Whole-body Thermal Sensation,"The subjective perception of overall warmth or coolness, integrating thermal inputs from local sensations across different body segments. whole-body thermal sensation does not always align with whole-body comfort, as an individual may feel slightly warm or cool while still being comfortable. this sensation is typically assessed using standardized thermal scales (e.g., from ""cold"" to ""hot"").",Thermophysiology
Whole-body Thermal State,"The physiological and perceptual condition of an individual in response to thermal stimuli, determined by core body temperature, local skin temperatures, and thermoregulatory responses (such as vasodilation, vasoconstriction, sweating, or shivering). the whole-body thermal state is dynamic, continuously adjusting based on environmental conditions, metabolic activity, and behavioural adaptations.",Thermophysiology
