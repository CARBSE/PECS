 Model-specific Features: the Cooling Jacket Features an Air Cooling and Moisture Removal Chamber (acmr), Where Two Blowers Pump Air From the Left and Right Sides Into a Tree-like Branching Tubing System That Distributes Airflow to the Upper Chest and Back. This Assembly, Defined As Part a, Facilitates Internal Air Circulation Within the Protective Clothing. Cooling Power Is Supplied by Part B, an External Te Cooling Unit Attached Via Magnets. the Hot Side of the Te Unit Dissipates Heat to the Environment. Inside the Acmr, Spindle-shaped Fins Are Arranged in a Spiral to Direct Airflow. in Cooling Mode, Warm, Humid Air Enters the Acmr Through Two Inlets, Exchanges Heat with the Fins, and Condenses Moisture on the Cold Inner Surface. the Condensed Water Is Expelled Through an Outlet, Collected in a Small Container, and Connected to the Water Disposal System Inside the Protective Clothing. Dried Air Then Circulates Back Through the Tubing System to Cool the Body.",Cooling,Conduction,Wearable,
